# Movie Management System

## Project Overview
The Movie Management System is a web application that allows users to manage movies, studios, and actors. It demonstrates the use of Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core Web API while efficiently handling one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. The system also includes an image feature for studios and an authorization feature for performing main operations such as Adding, Editing, and Deleting.

## Controllers and Views
The application contains three main controllers: **Actor**, **Movie**, and **Studio**. Each controller manages its respective entity and provides views for displaying data.

### **Actor Controller**
The ActorPage contains the following views:

- **ActorPage/List.cshtml**: Displays a list of all actors.
- **ActorPage/Details.cshtml**: Displays detailed information about a specific actor.
- **ActorPage/New.cshtml**: Displays a form to add a new actor.
- **ActorPage/ConfirmDelete.cshtml**: Displays a delete confirmation page where the user can either confirm the deletion of an actor or cancel to go back without performing the delete operation.
- **ActorPage/Edit.cshtml**: Displays a form to update an actor in the database.

### **Movie Controller**
The MoviePage contains the following views:

- **MoviePage/List.cshtml**: Displays a list of all movies.
